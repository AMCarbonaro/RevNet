## ðŸ”„ Progression Logic

### Unlocking Mechanism

```typescript
// Letter unlocking logic
const isLetterUnlocked = (letter: Letter, userProgress: LetterProgress) => {
  // First letter is always unlocked
  if (letter.id === 1) return true;
  
  // Check if previous letter is completed
  return userProgress.completedLetters.includes(letter.id - 1);
};

// Feature unlocking based on letter completion
const getUnlockedFeatures = (completedLetters: number[]) => {
  const features = [];
  
  if (completedLetters.length >= 7) {
    features.push('join_existing_revolts');
  }
  
  if (completedLetters.length >= 15) {
    features.push('create_local_revolts');
  }
  
  if (completedLetters.length >= 28) {
    features.push('create_national_revolts');
  }
  
  if (completedLetters.length >= 30) {
    features.push('discord_interface_access', 'revolutionary_badge');
  }
  
  return features;
};

// Check if user can access Discord interface
const canAccessDiscordInterface = (userProgress: LetterProgress): boolean => {
  return userProgress.completedLetters.length >= 30;
};

// Get next available letter
const getNextAvailableLetter = (userProgress: LetterProgress): number | null => {
  const completedCount = userProgress.completedLetters.length;
  if (completedCount >= 30) return null; // All letters completed
  return completedCount + 1;
};
```

### Progress Tracking

```typescript
interface LetterProgress {
  completedLetters: number[];   // Array of completed letter IDs
  currentLetter: number;        // Current letter being worked on
  totalLetters: number;         // Total number of letters (30)
  completedAt?: Date;           // Completion timestamp
  assignments: AssignmentProgress[]; // Assignment completion status
}
