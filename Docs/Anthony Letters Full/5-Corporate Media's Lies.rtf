\f1\b0 \cf0 \strokec2 Dear Friend,\
Bernie's blackout wasn't random\'97it was corporate media doing what it does best: protecting power. But forget left or right; media bias isn't ideological. It's 
\f0\b structural
\f1\b0 , wired to serve the elite who own the airwaves. The press isn't your watchdog; it's the lapdog of those who pay its bills.\
At the core is 
\f0\b corporate media monopoly
\f1\b0 . Six conglomerates\'97AT&T (now Warner Bros. Discovery), Comcast, Disney, Paramount, News Corp, and Sony\'97control 90% of U.S. media. They own the networks, studios, newspapers, and streaming services. Conflicts of interest abound: Disney lobbies against antitrust while producing "progressive" films; Comcast fights net neutrality to throttle competitors. Consolidation means one story line dominates, sanitized for shareholder value.\

\f0\b \cf0 Advertising revenue
\f1\b0  pulls the strings. Pharma ads alone make up 75% of prime-time TV commercials, funding shows that never question drug pricing or opioid epidemics. In 2023, drug companies spent $6.5 billion on ads\'97more than the entire federal budget for public broadcasting. Networks chase eyeballs, not truth; sensationalism sells, nuance doesn't. When coverage threatens advertisers\'97like exposing ExxonMobil's climate lies\'97it's buried.\
Enter 
\f0\b access journalism
\f1\b0 : Reporters trade independence for scoops from insiders. Embed with the Pentagon, get "exclusive" war footage; criticize, and doors slam. This breeds 
\f0\b false equivalence
\f1\b0 , where a fringe denier's claim gets equal airtime to 99 scientists. Climate change? "Both sides." Election denial? "Debate." It dilutes reality, making absurdity mainstream.\
Coverage prioritizes 
\f0\b horse race over substance
\f1\b0 : Who\'92s winning polls, not what policies mean. In 2020, endless Trump-Biden drama drowned out discussions of inequality or endless wars. Voters get spectacle, not solutions\'97keeping the public distracted and divided.\

\f0\b Corporate capture
\f1\b0  completes the loop. Newsrooms are run by executives from the same boardrooms they report on. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, shaping coverage to favor Amazon's empire. Sinclair Broadcast Group forces local anchors to parrot right-wing scripts. Editors prioritize clicks over facts, algorithms amplify outrage.\
Media isn't neutral; it's a profit machine aligned with power. It frames threats to the status quo as extremism, while normalizing inequality and endless profit. But cracks show: Independent voices online bypass the gatekeepers, proving the old model fragile.\
Next, we'll uncover the real conspiracies\'97not tinfoil, but documented takeovers hiding in plain sight.\
Question everything you watch,\
Anthony\
