# How to Fix the Render Service

## The Problem

Your service was created manually and is ignoring the `render.yaml` file.

## The Solution

You have TWO options:

### Option 1: Connect Service to Blueprint (Easiest)

1. Go to your backend service in Render
2. Look for "Blueprints" section in the left sidebar
3. Click "Connect to Blueprint" 
4. Select your `render.yaml` file
5. Save

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate (Most Reliable)

1. **Delete your current `revnet3-backend` service**
2. In Render dashboard, click "New +" → "Blueprint"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
5. Click "Apply" on the services it finds
6. This will create all services from the YAML file

## Why This Happened

If you created the service manually through "New Web Service" instead of using the Blueprint, it's using dashboard settings instead of YAML settings.

## After Connecting

Once connected to Blueprint:
- ✅ Root Directory will be automatically `backend`
- ✅ Build command will be `npm ci && npm run build`
- ✅ Start command will be `npm start`
- ✅ All environment variables will be set
